NEED HELP FIGURING OUT THE QUILL ICON ISSUE! WHAT IS HAPPENING????????

Dropdown still not working in views located in subdirectories

Add Genre to campaigns: change appearance of encounter log based on genre?
  fantasy/sci-fi/modern

Is there a way to condense the three new character actions into a single action?


Need help with responsive scaling. (example: encounters index page, have "scroll-log" shrink to fit viewport)
